Hi, i need to make a blackjack simulator to determine a house edge. 

It needs to be simulated exactly like it would be played in real life so that the outcome is accurate. And it needs a few adjustable controls so that i can test different scenarios. 

However, the way the cards are drawn will be the same every time. I dont need to account for any player decisions. 


I’ll probably need to run about a million hands. Idk the exact number but enough where the calculated house edge stops moving. Then it should give a report that includes
- All variables that were input
- How many total hands were run
- How many hands the player and dealer won/pushed
- Number of times that each hand occurred (player total vs dealer total)
- What the house edge is after averaging out every hand

This is going to be a custom variant of blackjack. But regular blackjack can be used as a base. In this variant the player bets on the dealer hand rather than their own hand.

A lot of these things i might want to adjust but these are the basic rules for the game.
- The player hits on their hand the same as the dealer.
- If the player and dealer both bust, the hand pushes.
- If the player and dealer both get a blackjack, the hand pushes.
- 5% commission is taken out.

The controls for the simulation are
- How many hand are run
- What totals the player hits on. (There should also be a way to check what the dealer up card is when the player hits. But by default, this wont be used.)
- Hit on soft 17 (There should be a separate control for the player and the dealer).
- Commission percentage (default 5%)
- Number of decks in the shoe (default 6)
- Shoe (shuffle once there are 52 or less cards) or Continuous shuffle (after every hand)
- Blackjack payout (default 1 to 1)
- How many players are at the table (default 1)


yeah its kind of like baccarat. the player bets that the dealer will win, they draw cards like the dealer, then if the dealer beats their hand, they win.

i guess i would say a list of rules would work best. i want to be able to check the player total and the dealer up card when controlling how the player hits. so for example, i could say, the player always stops on 17 but stops of 15 if the dealer has a 5 or 6. and soft hands need to be controlled separately.

i would want a full breakdown for the outcome frequency tracking. something i could throw in a spreadsheet to get a good visual of everything that’s happening
