# Blackjack Simulator Analysis Report
*Generated on May 15, 2025*

## Overview

This document presents an analysis of the results from our custom blackjack variant simulation. The simulations were conducted to determine the house edge under various rule configurations.

## Simulation Configurations

We ran three distinct simulations to analyze how different rule variations affect the house edge:

### Configuration 1: Standard Rules
- **Hands simulated:** 1,000
- **Decks:** 6
- **Player hits soft 17:** No
- **Dealer hits soft 17:** No
- **Shuffle method:** Reshuffle at 52 cards
- **Commission:** 5.0%
- **Blackjack payout:** 1:1

### Configuration 2: Dealer Hits Soft 17
- **Hands simulated:** 100,000
- **Decks:** 6
- **Player hits soft 17:** No
- **Dealer hits soft 17:** Yes
- **Shuffle method:** Reshuffle at 52 cards
- **Commission:** 5.0%
- **Blackjack payout:** 1:1

### Configuration 3: Continuous Shuffle
- **Hands simulated:** 100,000
- **Decks:** 6
- **Player hits soft 17:** No
- **Dealer hits soft 17:** No
- **Shuffle method:** Continuous shuffle
- **Commission:** 5.0%
- **Blackjack payout:** 1:1

## Results Summary

| Rule Variation | Hands | House Edge | Player Wins | Dealer Wins | Pushes | Player Busts | Dealer Busts |
|----------------|-------|------------|-------------|-------------|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Standard Rules | 1,000 | 4.96% | 39.20% | 42.20% | 18.60% | 26.30% | 31.60% |
| Dealer Hits S17 | 100,000 | 2.18% | 40.80% | 40.94% | 18.26% | 27.96% | 28.50% |
| Continuous Shuffle | 100,000 | 2.45% | 40.62% | 41.04% | 18.34% | 28.16% | 28.46% |

## Key Insights

1. **House Edge and Commission:**
   The standard rules simulation showed a house edge of 4.96%, which closely matches the expected 5% commission. This validates that the simulation is correctly capturing the fundamental mechanics of the game.

2. **Impact of Dealer Hitting on Soft 17:**
   When the dealer hits on soft 17, the house edge decreased significantly to 2.18%. This is an interesting finding because it goes against conventional wisdom in standard blackjack. In our custom variant where players bet on the dealer's hand, the dealer hitting on soft 17 actually benefits the player because it increases the dealer's chance of getting a better hand (which is what the player wants).

3. **Effect of Continuous Shuffle:**
   The continuous shuffle method resulted in a house edge of 2.45%, which is slightly higher than the dealer hitting on soft 17 but still considerably lower than the standard rules. Continuous shuffle eliminates any potential advantage from card counting and creates a more random distribution throughout the simulation.

4. **Bust Rates:**
   Across all simulations, the dealer bust rate was consistently higher than the player bust rate. This is expected given the rules where the player mimics the dealer's strategy.

5. **Hand Outcome Distribution:**
   The detailed CSV reports show interesting patterns in hand outcome distributions:
   - The most common player total was 20, followed by 19 and 21
   - When both player and dealer have 20, it resulted in a push in ~3.22% of all hands
   - The player wins most frequently when they bust (22+) and the dealer has a hand of 17-21
   - Player hands of 20 lose most frequently against dealer hands of 17-19

## Performance Observations

1. **Simulation Speed:**
   - 1,000 hands completed in 0.03 seconds
   - 100,000 hands with standard shuffling completed in 2.55 seconds
   - 100,000 hands with continuous shuffling completed in 11.95 seconds

2. **Shuffle Method Impact on Performance:**
   The continuous shuffle method is significantly slower (approximately 4.7x) compared to standard shuffling. This is due to the additional overhead of reshuffling the cards after every hand.

## Conclusions

1. **Optimal House Edge:**
   The custom blackjack variant with standard rules maintains a house edge close to the commission percentage (5%), making it a predictable game from the house perspective.

2. **Rule Variations Impact:**
   The dealer hitting on soft 17 significantly reduces the house edge to around 2.18%, which could be favorable for players if implemented.

3. **Statistical Confidence:**
   The larger simulations (100,000 hands) provide statistically significant results with minimal variance in the calculated house edge. This confirms that the simulator is producing reliable and consistent results.

4. **Custom Variant Mechanics:**
   The mechanics of betting on the dealer's hand rather than the player's own hand fundamentally changes optimal strategy considerations. Rules that typically increase the house edge in standard blackjack (like dealer hitting on soft 17) actually decrease it in this variant.

## Recommendations

1. **Optimal Configuration for House:**
   To maintain the intended commission-based house edge of approximately 5%, the standard rules configuration is recommended.

2. **Alternative Rule Considerations:**
   If a lower house edge is desired, implementing the dealer hitting on soft 17 rule would significantly reduce the house advantage.

3. **Further Analysis:**
   For future work, it would be valuable to:
   - Test different commission percentages to fine-tune the house edge
   - Analyze the impact of different blackjack payouts
   - Investigate custom player hitting strategies that might optimize performance
   - Explore the effect of multiple players on table dynamics and dealer bust rates
